Currently pursuing a PhD in context-aware recommender systems.

Master in Advanced Telecommunication Technologies in UPC, with major in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which arose from high interest of learning more and more when working as a Research Assistant with the Insight Centre for Data Analytics in fields such as machine learning, deep learning and data science.

I am really fond of researching as well as being really interested in human relationships and behaviour. Thus, I usually complement my work with volunteer tasks. I really love to learn and I do it very quickly. For me is very important the work I do and I could not imagine working without having a motivation which goes beyond just “doing what I have to do today”.

I do believe that I have great social skills which make me love teamwork and allow me to perform in different environments. In my opinion, people who surround you are fundamental to improve your knowledge and your skills, that's why I love traveling and learning from other people’s cultures. However, I think that daily life actions are also really important and are what lets you discover new outlooks on life.

Research Interests: Data Science, Machine learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Recommender Systems, CARS, Image and Video processing, Object Detection, Object Classification, Content-based Image Retrieval Systems, Graph Neural Networks, Graph Convolutional Networks.

Software Development Skills: Python, Pytorch, Javascript, ReactJS, NodeJS, C, Java, MATLAB, LaTeX, Bash, SQL, HTML, SCSS and CSS.

Documentation Tools: JSDoc, Github, Bitbucket, LaTex (Overleaf) and Docker.
